| General topic?               | Cure the common cold with making the human cell a unwelcome place for the virus                       |
| Procedure/what was examined? | Scientist suspect that common cold viruses absolutly need a particular protein (called SETD3) for his growth and his spreading. So they tried to enable the production of this protein to make the cell an "unwelcome place" for the viruses.  |
| Conclusions/discovery?       |     They applied this in mice and they were viable and fertile but with some muscles contractions problems.    |
| Remaining questions | Does inhibiting the production of SETD3 cause problems in the human body? |
