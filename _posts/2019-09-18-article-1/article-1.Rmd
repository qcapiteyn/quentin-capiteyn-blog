| Published in?                | October 2, 2019                                                       |
| General topic?               | Modify the genome of fruit flies for give them ability to withstand milkweed toxins                      |
| Procedure/what was examined? | First it was a supposition that 3 amino acid in the ATPalpha were responsible of the ability of the butterflies, so researchers used CRISPR/Cas9 (a tool able to lyse and replace short sequences of the genome.) to modify fruit flies' genome and give them the resistance to milkweed toxin. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       |     They successful turned regular fruit flies into "monarch flies", but this ability has a price. The flies' nervous systems were less able to handle stress.    |
